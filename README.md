## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS

I used HTML and CSS to create a static mirror of The Atlantic. I built the basic structure of the content with HTML, using sections and articles as needed semantically. I used CSS to style the content and adjust the widths of the sections and images to match the styling of the site I was trying to mirror. 

## Lessons Learned:

In this project I learned how to link fonts to a file. I also learned the basis of floats and how to use them to to create my layout.
